(in-development)

Composition environment for an experimental, Javanese-like Gamelan ensemble.

Instruments of the ensemble may finally include...
	* one siter panerus
	* one siter barung
	* two siter slenthem
	* one 'siter gong' 
	* two bamboo slide flutes
	* two adapted kecapi siter
	* six Sundanese kendang anak
	* one Burmese bamboo clapper

Different plans and sketches as well as the expected tunings for the individual instruments can be found [here](https://github.com/uummoo/nongkrong/blob/master/other/instruments). The instruments are still in production by different Pengrajin Gamelan in Yogyakarta, Surakarta and Bandung.

The ensemble is supposed to be played by 9 persons.

The tuning of the ensemble is based on Wilsons common-product-set scale. While the scale is clearly represented by the siter slenthem, the pitches of the other registers and instruments differ from this scale.
